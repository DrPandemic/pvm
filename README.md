# pvm
Easily manage Python versions.

# Goal
There is already many solutions like : [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and others. But there is none really simple to use.
The inspiration comes from [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and [rvm](https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm). 
The initiale goal is to have a limited set of functions, but just enough to be able to quickly run application with any version of Python on your system.

# Usage
```pvm list``` to get the list of installed versions.

```pvm use version``` to set this your python version.
